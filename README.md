# ECG Heartbeat Categorization

## Overview

This repository contains a machine learning model designed to categorize ECG heartbeat data . The model utilizes data from an kaggle database to perform classification and aggregation, aiding organizations in identifying and evaluating core competencies through heartbeat analysis. Compare between uni and multi ML model performance.

## Project Structure

- **`data/`**: Contains the heartbeat dataset. [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shayanfazeli/heartbeat)
- **`Kaggle/`** [Notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/code/manarm7md/ecg-heartbeat-categorization-ml) that detail data processing, model training, and evaluation steps.
  
## Getting Started
